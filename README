Tcl wrappers for Gordon't WiringPi Library

Uses Gadgetoid's wiringpi.i, modified to remove explicit paths and use the version of WiringPi installed on the system.

You will need swig and tcl-devel installed.

To build, just run:

./build

And the Tcl extension will be built and installed to the first available directory in Tcl's auto_path

Just add "package require wiringpi" at the start of your tcl script to use it

Global variables are created to match some of Gordon's #defines:

pinMode:
INPUT, OUTPUT and PWM_OUTPUT

digitalWrite:
LOW and HIGH

The following Tcl commands are also defined for convenience:

mode <pins> <mode> : calls pinMode to set the mode for each pin in a list of pins
on <pins>          : Sets each pin in a list of pins to HIGH
off <pins>         : Sets each pin in list of pins to LOW

flash <pins> [delay 100] [repeat 1] : Set the pins HIGH and LOW with an optional delay (default 100ms) and optional repeat

Enjoy!
